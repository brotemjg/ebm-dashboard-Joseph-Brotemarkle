# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1:
- **Specific:** The performance of teams would be measured.
- **Measurable:** The performance would be measured in their percentage of successful outcomes according to their direct manager.
- **Achievable:** Yes it is. We would only have to interview and survey the managers to recieve outcomes.
- **Relevant:** This addresses the core problem of deacreased performance among remote work teams.
- **Time-bound:** Within a twelve week period, six weeks for a baseline and six weeks with the proposed intervention.

### Criterion 2:
- **Specific:** The percieved cohesiveness of teams would be measured.
- **Measurable:** Employees will be surveyed and interviewed on how they percieve their team cohesion to be.
- **Achievable:** Yes. We would only need to conduct perdiodic surveys and interviews. These are not very costly.
- **Relevant:** Yes. The main problem stems from communication with remote workers and the teams they work in.
- **Time-bound:** This will be measured in the 12 week window as proposed. However surveys could continue beyond that to gain a better insight into how well teams are working together.

### Criterion 3: 
- **Specific:** The long-term profits of companies.
- **Measurable:** The end year profits of companies will be measured.
- **Achievable:** Yes, this information is easy to obtain and analyze.
- **Relevant:** Yes, overall companies want to make a profit. The proposed intervention will ultimately have a positive effect on how muhc money the company is generating.
- **Time-bound:** This will take years in order to measure and compare before versus after the intervention.

## Baseline Measurements

### Current State Metrics


**Metric 1:** Team Performance = [Current value]

### Data Collection Plan
Through emails and communication with the company being intervened with.

## Timeline for Assessment

### Short-term (30-90 days)
    - How well teams are working and communicating with each other.
