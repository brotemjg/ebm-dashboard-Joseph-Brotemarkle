# Solution Constraints Template

Use this file to record constraints that limit solution design and implementation for your project.

## Project context
- Project Topic: [e.g., Hybrid work]
- Organization/Unit: [e.g., AcmeCo - Customer Ops]
- Timeframe: [e.g., Q4 2025 pilot window]

## Budget constraints
- Available budget (one-time): [amount]
- Available budget (recurring/monthly): [amount]
- Procurement lead time: [weeks]
- Restrictions (e.g., no external consultants): [notes]

## Timeline constraints
- Earliest start date: [date]
- Required completion date: [date]
- Key milestone dates: [milestone 1 - date; milestone 2 - date]

## Technical constraints
- Systems available (LMS, Slack, Teams, Jira, bespoke tools): [list]
- Integration limitations (API access, SSO, data export): [notes]
- Data retention and storage policies: [notes]

## Legal and compliance constraints
- Data privacy requirements (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA if applicable): [notes]
- HR policy constraints (monitoring, off-hours contact): [notes]
- Contractual obligations with third parties: [notes]

## Human resources / capacity
- Available staff hours for pilot (FTE-equivalent): [estimate]

- Consent requirements for recordings/surveys: [notes]
- Psychological safety considerations: [notes]

## Operational constraints
- Time zone coverage: [notes]
- Coverage windows (e.g., core hours): [notes]
- On-call or critical role constraints: [notes]

## Measurement and evaluation constraints
- Data access limits for outcomes (e.g., can't access individual-level productivity logs): [notes]
- Minimum sample size needed for pilot: [notes]
- Frequency of measurement allowed (weekly, monthly): [notes]

## Risk and mitigation considerations
- Key risks related to constraints and proposed mitigations:
  1. [Risk] — [Mitigation]
  2. [Risk] — [Mitigation]

## Approval and escalation
- Decision owners: [names / roles]
- Approval thresholds (budget / timeline): [notes]
- Escalation path: [contacts and steps]
