# Scientific search & methods (CEBMa-aligned)

Purpose: Provide a concise, reproducible search strategy and study selection workflow for the project topic: Hybrid work.

Scope & constraints
- Topic: Hybrid work (employee engagement, performance, non-invasive interventions).
- Access: No institutional databases; prioritize open-access sources (Google Scholar, PubMed OA, SSRN, arXiv, institutional repositories, Google, direct publisher OA pages).
- Designs of interest: RCTs, quasi-experimental (difference-in-differences, matched controls), cohort studies, cross-sectional surveys (for prevalence & correlates), and qualitative process/implementation studies.

Search principles (CEBMa-influenced)
- Use title/abstract field qualifiers when available (e.g., TI/AB, title:, intitle:), but adapt for Google Scholar (which lacks field-level boolean syntax) by placing strong keywords in quotes and combining with AND/OR.
- Build a small set of high-precision queries first, then iteratively broaden with synonyms and related constructs.
- Prioritize sensitivity for the evidence-for-effect question (interventions) and precision for baseline/problem prevalence questions.
- Record all searches verbatim and save results lists (export or copy) to a reproducible search log (see PRISMA-style logging below).

TI()/AB() and adaptations
- When a database supports TI()/AB(): use it for focused searches. Example (database with TI/AB):
  (TI(hybrid OR "hybrid work" OR "remote work" OR "work from home") OR AB(hybrid OR "hybrid work" OR "remote work" OR "work from home"))
  AND (TI(engagement OR productivity OR performance OR "employee engagement") OR AB(engagement OR productivity OR performance OR "employee engagement"))
  AND (TI(intervention OR trial OR program OR coaching OR "team check-in" OR microlearning) OR AB(intervention OR trial OR program OR coaching OR "team check-in" OR microlearning))

- Google Scholar adaptation (no TI/AB):
  Use quoted phrases and combine with AND/OR. Example high-precision Google Scholar string:
  "hybrid work" OR "remote work" OR "work from home" AND "employee engagement" OR productivity OR performance AND (intervention OR trial OR program OR coaching OR "team check-in" OR microlearning)

  Tips for Google Scholar:
  - Use quotes for multi-word phrases: "hybrid work" "employee engagement".
  - Use the site: operator to limit to specific domains (e.g., site:edu, site:gov) when needed.
  - Sort by relevance, then by date when looking for recent evidence.
  - Export citations using the "Cite" button (BibTeX/EndNote) where available; copy direct links for the search log.

Example search strings (open-access focused)
- Google Scholar (high-precision):
  "hybrid work" "employee engagement" intervention OR trial OR program OR coaching

- PubMed (adapted; use title/abstract fields):
  ("hybrid work"[Title/Abstract] OR "remote work"[Title/Abstract] OR "work from home"[Title/Abstract]) AND ("employee engagement"[Title/Abstract] OR productivity[Title/Abstract] OR performance[Title/Abstract]) AND (intervention[Title/Abstract] OR trial[Title/Abstract] OR coaching[Title/Abstract] OR microlearning[Title/Abstract])

- SSRN / institutional repositories (use site search + quotes):
  "hybrid work" "employee engagement" intervention site:ssrn.com OR site:edu

Search execution checklist
1. Draft 3–5 high-precision queries for each major question (problem prevalence, effectiveness of interventions, implementation/process evidence).
2. Run queries in Google Scholar and at least one OA index (PubMed OA, SSRN, arXiv if applicable).
3. Export or save the first 200 results for each query (Google Scholar limits scraping; consider paginating and saving links manually).
4. Record the exact query, date run, database, and number of hits in the search log.
5. De-duplicate results across platforms using title + author heuristics.

Screening & selection
- Title/abstract screening: use the inclusion/exclusion criteria below. Keep reasons for exclusion in the log (e.g., wrong population, observational only, non-empirical).
- Full-text review: extract key design features, sample size, context, outcomes measured, effect estimates, and implementation notes.

Inclusion criteria (adapt to question)
- Population: employees working in hybrid arrangements OR studies explicitly reporting mixed remote/onsite samples with subgroup analyses or contextual detail.
- Intervention: structured programs targeting engagement or performance (e.g., team check-ins, asynchronous reporting systems, microlearning, manager coaching). Include comparative or pre-post designs.
- Outcomes: employee engagement (validated scales or pulse scores), productivity/performance metrics, attendance/absenteeism, task completion rates, or validated behavioral proxies.
- Study designs: RCTs, controlled quasi-experiments, cohort studies, cross-sectional (for prevalence/correlates), qualitative studies with implementation focus.
- Language: English (unless you can translate reliably).
- Date range: no restriction initially; prioritize recent 10 years during screening.

Exclusion criteria
- Purely opinion pieces, commentary, or editorials without empirical data.
- Studies on surveillance/time-tracking technology as the primary intervention (unless relevant as a comparison).
- Populations outside employment contexts (e.g., student remote learning) unless directly transferable with clear justification.

Data extraction template (fields to collect for each included study)
- Citation (authors, year, title, journal/source)
- URL / DOI
- Study design (RCT, quasi-experimental, cohort, cross-sectional, qualitative)
- Population and sample size; country and sector; hybrid work definition used
- Intervention details (components, duration, intensity)
- Comparison condition
- Outcomes measured (instruments, unit of measurement)
- Effect estimates and precision (means, SDs, odds ratios, confidence intervals) where available
- Risk of bias / appraisal flags (see appraisal checklist file)
- Implementation notes (fidelity, acceptability, barriers)
- Notes / remarks (applicability to AcmeCo context)

Appraisal & synthesis plan (brief)
- Use the CEBMa-style, design-specific checklists in `content/evidence-scientific-appraisal.txt` for internal validity flags.
- For effectiveness: prioritize RCTs and high-quality quasi-experiments; synthesize narratively and only meta-analyze when estimates are compatible and heterogeneity is low.
- For prevalence/correlates: report ranges and typical measures; avoid pooling across very different contexts.
- For qualitative evidence: use thematic synthesis to extract implementation facilitators and barriers.

PRISMA-style search log (minimum fields)
- Search ID
- Date
- Database / platform
- Exact query string
- Hits returned
- Hits screened (title/abstract)
- Full texts assessed
- Included
- Excluded (with top reasons)
- Link to saved results or exported file

Reproducibility & transparency notes
- Save raw search lists (CSV or text) in a `data/search-logs/` folder and reference them in the PRISMA log.
- Keep a short README in `data/search-logs/README.txt` explaining how results were saved and de-duplication rules.

Practical tips for no-institution-access searches
- Focus on Google Scholar and publisher OA pages; use site:edu and site:gov to find white papers and government reports.
- Search for preprints and working papers (SSRN, ResearchGate, institutional repositories).
- Check references and cited-by in Google Scholar for backward/forward citation chasing.
- Use browser PDF viewers and save PDFs with a consistent filename convention: author_year_journal_title.pdf.

Next steps you can ask me to run
- Generate 4–6 polished Google Scholar query strings tuned to the project's PICOC and ready-to-copy.
- Create a `data/search-logs/README.txt` and a PRISMA CSV template for logging searches and screening counts.
- Draft a short protocol snippet (one-page) summarizing the search strategy for Milestone 2.
